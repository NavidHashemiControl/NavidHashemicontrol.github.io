We extended one of the most popular recent techniques for Lipschitz constant analysis of neural networks, [LipSDP](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/95e1533eb1b20a97777749fb94fdb944-Abstract.html), by reformulating it to provide tight and computationally efficient guarantees for **local** Lipschitz constants. We called this open source contribution [Local-LipSDP](https://github.com/NavidHashemiControl/Local_LipSDP_L4DC_2021). This technique significantly enhances the accuracy and scalability of robustness analysis for neural networks. Furthermore, we demonstrated the substantial contribution of this technique to the verification of autonomous systems operated by neural network feedback controllers.
